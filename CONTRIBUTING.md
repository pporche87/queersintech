* Write intention revealing code - use well named identifiers for variables, functions, css classes, etc.
* Functions are small and serve a single purpose
* Documentation is updated (including the [readme](README.md), and any API documentation)
* All tests passing - aiming for 100% test coverage
* Spaces (2), not tabs
* No lines may be longer than 80 characters
<!-- * Tests must be written for new features or changes to features. -->
